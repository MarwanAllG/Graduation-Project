# Graduation-Project: Analysis of the Used Car Market in Saudi Arabia Using Machine and Deep Learning

## The Project Aim
The project aims to analyze the used car market in Saudi Arabia using different algorithms and predict the price of a used car based on several attributes: Mileage, Brand, Model, Year, Engine Size, Region, Color, Fuel Type, and Gear Type.
## Data
The data collected for the project is collected from different famous websites in Saudi Arabia that offer the service of selling and buying used cars, like syarah.com.
## Algorithms/Models Used
9 Different machine learning models and a deep learning model were tested during this project.

## Best Model, Deployment, and Dashboard
The best model was the Extra Regressor with an R squared accuracy of 95.7%, mean absolute error of 10188.7, and mean absolute percentage error of 14.7%.
The model then was deployed to a web application so that end users can use it and try to estimate the price of their used car. Also, an interactive dashboard was created to summarize the market and identify the most affecting factors on car prices.
